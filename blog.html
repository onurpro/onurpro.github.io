			2019/9/13 -- First Weeks Of School #002 <br>
			
			<b> The Price I'm Willing To Pay </b> <br>
			<p>
				These last two weeks didn't go as expected, it took a lot longer to get into my groove than it usually does. The first week I was upset because I had two classes with this girl that
				I wanted to get to know better but they changed my schedule and ruined that but there is hope for me we usually text every now and then so maybe there is a chance for us to become better friends. This week
				was quite boring except for the last two days; a lot happend. I managed to make a couple poeple laugh in french class and the day after I got super sad and I don't eve know why, it just sorta happend. That
				got me thinking because the day before a kid came up to me and said "Hey Onur I've been feeling sad cheer me up" and I was like woah this kid came up to <b> ME </b> and asked <b> ME </b> to make him laugh, it's 
				crazy he has alot of friends in this class but he came to me out of everyone that was pretty amazing thought so I do a usual me and make everyone laugh inluding him. Next day I step on school grounds and 
				just felt sad which got me to thinking "What is the price" have I made a deal with the devil? is the price of making them laugh my happiness? If so I am I willing to pay the price. The more poeple that laugh 
				at my jokes the sadder I become? The more i got to thinking the more I was like 'yea' I am willing to be sad if it means my friends are always happy or lauging. On the other side of the scale there is my mom 
				who is getting woried but she shouldn't be I'm amazing everyday I make someone smile or laugh in life right now thats what I need. <br>

			2019/9/3 --  First Day Of School #001 <br>
			
			<b> Failing Expectations That Didn't Exist <b> <br>
			<p> 
				So the first day of school was today and even thought is was only 12 minutes I was pretty happy; I tend to get pretty alone over the summmer so being surrounded by familier faces made me feel happy. Before
				the 12 minutes I met up with Noah and Caleb we mostly talk about our classes and bus stations(you know, the usual). After those long 12 minutes I felt as though the day failed to meet expectations as though
				I failed some sort of expectation which is unuasual because I don't remeber waking up and say how this day was going to play out. Yet it felt like it didn't meet my standards, was it because no one really
				noticed me? I just have this need to be noticed and make poeple laugh. Tomorrow is the first long day which is insane because that day exactly one year ago I had a mild anxiety attack so we'll see how it
				goes. Have a great day. <br>
