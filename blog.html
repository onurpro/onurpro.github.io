			2019/9/3 --  First Day Of School #001 <br>
			
			<b> Failing Expectations That Didn't Exist <b> <br>
			<p> 
				So the first day of school was today and even thought is was only 12 minutes I was pretty happy; I tend to get pretty alone over the summmer so being surrounded by familier faces made me feel happy. Before
				the 12 minutes I met up with Noah and Caleb we mostly talk about our classes and bus stations(you know, the usual). After those long 12 minutes I felt as though the day failed to meet expectations as though
				I failed some sort of expectation which is unuasual because I don't remeber waking up and say how this day was going to play out. Yet it felt like it didn't meet my standards, was it because no one really
				noticed me? I just have this need to be noticed and make poeple laugh. Tomorrow is the first long day which is insane because that day exactly one year ago I had a mild anxiety attack so we'll see how it
				goes. Have a great day. <br>
